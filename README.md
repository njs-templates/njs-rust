A nice and simple Rust template to let me (or anyone else) quickly whip up new projects.

## Installation

You can download this repo as a .zip or clone it with git,
but a cleaner approach is with [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit).

```bash
npx degit njs-templates/njs-rust new-project
cd new-project
yarn
```

## Recommended IDE

This was meant to be used with VS Code, but it should work with any editor.
You'll be prompted to install any recommended extensions that aren't installed.
If no one on your team is using VS Code, just delete the `.vscode/` folder.

## Next steps

- [ ] Run `cargo run` to build the project and make sure everything's working.
- [ ] Delete `LICENSE.txt` from the root of the directory.
    - If your project still uses an MIT License, just edit the author and year.
- [ ] Either delete `CHANGELOG.md` or remove its contents.
- [ ] In `cargo.toml`, change the project name and version.
- [ ] Delete the `.git/` folder if you cloned this repo.
- [ ] Run a `git init` to start tracking changes.
- [ ] Do whatever. This code is yours now. Credit is appreciated but not needed.
